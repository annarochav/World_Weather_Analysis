# ðŸš€ World_Weather_Analysis
Challenge Week6 Data Analysis BootCamp using Python/ Jupyter Lab / Numpy / Matplotlib / Citipy / Pandas / Gmaps

## âš¡Overview of the proyect
Assist PlanMyTrip, a travel technology company to make analysis about the weather conditions around the world. The goal is to help travelers choose their destination based on the weather conditions that they prefer. Also, with this analysis, weâ€™re going to be able to recommend hotels and a travel itinerary map, to make life easier for the clients and get them a great experience.

## âš¡Results: 
**Weather Database**

We got 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes with the help of NumPy, CitiPy and the open weather map APIâ€™s. With the API call, we got the following data:

 + Latitudes and longitudes.
 + City name.
 + Max temperature.
 + Humidity.
 + Cloudiness.
 + Wind speed
 + Country
 + Date
 + Current weather description

**Vacation Search**

Once we have the travelerâ€™s weather preferences, we can look for cities and hotels that match. With the help of Google Maps, we can easily identify the results thanks to the markers and the information boxes.
